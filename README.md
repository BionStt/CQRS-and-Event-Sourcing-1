Going to create a Single Page Application with CQRS-ES Architecture. This is the first release and in this release I completed CQRS-ES Architecture with a Simple CRUD Application. I used MS SQL Server as database.

In coding I followed Greg Young’s Super Simple CQRS (https://github.com/gregoryyoung/m-r)
, Mark Nihof’s CQRS example (https://github.com/MarkNijhof/Fohjin) as well as Dave Craft’s CQRS example (https://github.com/CraftyFella/Simple-Cqrs-Example). 

The main purpose of this project to use restful interface with CQRS Pattern.

I am very new in CQRS-ES and Single Page application. Hope well everyone's help and contribution.
